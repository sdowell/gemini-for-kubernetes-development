# Watch Scanning & Task Orchestration Design Reference

This document details the unified design, architecture, and behavior of the `factory watch` background loop, which serves as the core scanning and orchestration daemon of the AI Factory.

---

## 1. Overview & Goals

The watch loop provides continuous monitoring of a target GitHub repository, transforming external events (issues, comments, and CI failures) into isolated coding tasks running inside cluster sandboxes.

The key goals of the watch loop design are:
* **Decoupled Scanning and Execution**: Separating event discovery (scanning) from task runs using a filesystem-based queue.
* **Smart Filtering**: Minimizing unnecessary tasks and API rate limits by skipping duplicate work (e.g., issues that already have open PRs).
* **Multi-Identity Coordination**: Automatically routing task execution to specific bot user accounts based on role mappings and ownership requirements.

## 2. Watch Loop Architecture

The daemon executes periodically (default: every 2 minutes) and follows a three-stage pipeline:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[1. GitHub Scan] -->|Write to incoming/| B[2. Queue Tasks]
    B -->|Move to processing/| C[3. Run Sandbox]
    C -->|Completion| D[Move to processed/]
```

1. **GitHub Scan**: Fetches open issues, open PRs, comments, reviews, and CI statuses from GitHub.
2. **Queue Tasks**: Evaluates conditions, resolves assignees, and writes task yaml specs to the `incoming/` queue folder.
3. **Run Sandbox**: Reads the queue, moves the task to `processing/` atomically, runs the child `factory` CLI command, and finally moves the task and log files to `processed/`.

---

## 3. Work Item Discovery & Deduplication Rules

The watcher uses the GitHub API to discover open issues and pull requests, applying specific filters based on labels, creators, and assignees. It automatically paginates all API queries to fetch all pages of issues, PRs, reviews, and comments, bypassing default API limits.

### A. Issue Discovery (Bugs & Chores)
The watcher fetches open issues matching any of the following criteria:
1. **Assigned to Watcher**: Issues assigned to the watcher bot's login username.
2. **Labeled with Trigger Label**: Issues that have the trigger label (e.g., `factory`, `overseer`).
3. **Created by Watcher**: Open issues created by the watcher bot account itself.

*Deduplication Filters*:
* **MinNumber Filter**: Ignored if the issue or PR ID is less than the configured `minNumber` threshold.
* **PR Filter**: The watcher ignores issues that are actually Pull Requests (where `PullRequestLinks != nil`).
* **Linked PR Check**: The watcher searches all open PRs in the repository. If an open PR references the issue number in its title, description, branch name, or via the GitHub Timeline API, the issue is skipped to prevent duplicate work.

### B. Pull Request Discovery
The watcher fetches open Pull Requests matching:
1. **Assigned to Watcher**: Pull Requests assigned to the watcher bot.
2. **Labeled with Trigger Label**: Pull Requests labeled with the trigger label.
3. **Bot Pool Origin**: Only PRs created by bot accounts defined in the configured bot pool are processed. Third-party or human PRs are ignored unless they are explicitly allowlisted.

## 4. Task Dispatch Matrix

Once the watcher has consolidated the active issues and PRs, it performs check-status queries to map them to specific task types:

| Item Type | Condition | Task Type | Spawned Command | Identity Selection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Issue** | Open issue assigned/labeled | `issue-fix` | `factory fix` | Mapped pool bot / Load-balanced coder |
| **PR** | CI check runs failed (Phase 3) | `pr-investigate` | `factory pr investigate` | Match PR author (must be in `coder` pool) |
| **PR** | New comment or review (Phase 2) | `pr-comments` | `factory pr address-comments` | Match PR author (must be in `coder` pool) |
| **PR** | Merge conflicts / out-of-date (Phase 1) | `pr-iterate` | `factory pr iterate` | Match PR author (must be in `coder` pool) |
| **PR** | Opened by third-party bot on allowlist | `pr-review` | `factory pr review` | Random user from `reviewer` pool |
| **PR** | Markdown workflow checklist file reference | `agent-chore` | `factory agent create` | Default fallback or mapped role |

---

## 5. Queueing & Concurrency Control

To ensure robustness, isolation, and low-latency API response times, the watcher operates through `TaskQueueManager` using thread-safe in-memory maps backed by write-through disk persistence to directory queues (`incoming/`, `processing/`, `processed/`) and append-only journal event logging (`queue/journal.log`):

1. **Scan Mode (`--mode=scan`)**: Performs GitHub and local queries, builds task specifications, and writes them atomically into `incoming/<task-id>.yaml` (ingested by the in-memory manager).
2. **Run Mode (`--mode=run`)**: Periodically drains the queue using an atomic candidate-claiming primitive (`ClaimNextCandidate`) rather than static batch snapshots:
   * **Priority Queue Scheduling**: Incoming tasks are maintained in a persistent in-memory min-heap (`TaskPriorityQueue`) ordered by priority tier (`critical` > `urgent` > `important` > `high` > `medium` > `low`), phase execution order (1 to 4), and arrival timestamp (`enqueuedAt` FIFO), eliminating the need to re-sort on every claim.
   * **Two-Phase Validation & Deferred Cycle Release**:
     - *Phase 1 (Lock Acquired)*: `ClaimNextCandidate` atomically reserves the top unblocked candidate task from `incoming/` in memory while leaving the file in `incoming/` on disk and `Status: Pending`.
     - *Phase 2 (Lock Released)*: The runner verifies external preconditions (Kubernetes sandbox pod status and GitHub stop labels/closed state) completely outside the mutex lock.
     - *Resource Conflict Handling*: If the target sandbox pod is currently busy or Kubernetes is temporarily unreachable, the runner collects the candidate in a cycle-scoped list of released tasks. A deferred function in `runTasks` invokes `ReleaseTask(filename)` upon function exit to restore all skipped tasks back to the ready heap. This eliminates **Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking**, prevents intra-cycle busy-spin thrashing, and avoids unnecessary disk I/O.
     - *Permanent Pruning*: If GitHub checks reveal an issue/PR is closed or labeled with `overseer/stop`, `RemoveTask` deletes it from memory and disk.
     - *Execution Start*: Once all checks pass, `StartTask` transitions the task to `processing/` (marks `Running`, sets `StartedAt`, moves file, logs journal event) right before launching execution in the sandbox.
3. **Completion**: Once the CLI command finishes in the sandbox:
   * **Success**: The task file and output logs are moved to `processed/` with `Status: Completed`.
   * **Failure**: The task is updated with `Status: Failed` and error details, then moved to `processed/`.

## 6. PR Processing Event Phases & Retry Logic

When processing a PR, the scan evaluates conditions and queues tasks in three phases:

### Phase 1: Rebase / Merge Conflicts (`pr-iterate`)
* **Trigger**: The PR is in a conflicting merge state (`Mergeable == false`).
* **Assignment**: The bot user stays assigned to the PR on GitHub while the rebase task is executing.

### Phase 2: Review Feedback / Comments (`pr-comments`)
* **Trigger**: A new comment or review is posted after the PR's last commit time and after `lastCommentAddressedTime`. Or, a pool bot is manually assigned to the PR as an override trigger.
* **Bot Filtering (`shouldIgnoreUser`)**:
  * Own watcher bot (`githubLogin`) and PR author comments are ignored.
  * System bots (matching `prow`, `-bot`, `-robot`, or `[bot]`) are ignored by default.
  * Allowlisted review bots (e.g. `reviewbot-robot` in `allowlistedBots`) are NOT ignored.
* **Assignment**: The bot user stays assigned to the PR on GitHub while addressing comments.

### Phase 3: CI Check Failures (`pr-investigate`)
* **Trigger**: Check runs or status checks for the head commit have failed.
* **Check Run Deduplication**: Check runs are deduplicated by name, keeping only the latest run (highest ID), ensuring older cancelled/failed runs do not block the PR if a newer run succeeded.
* **Automated Circuit Breaker (`overseer/stop`)**: If the bot attempts to investigate/fix CI failures (`started investigating CI check failures`) 3 times since the latest git commit OR latest human comment without success, it triggers an automated circuit breaker:
  * It attaches the `overseer/stop` label (`or <triggerLabel>/stop`) to the pull request and posts an informative comment explaining that automated investigation is paused.
  * **Effortless Retries (Unlabeling)**: To retry or resume automated investigation, a human maintainer simply removes the `overseer/stop` label (no comment or commit required). When un-labeled, the bot's pause comment (`pausing automated investigation`) acts as a new reset boundary, clearing the retry count (`investigationCount = 0`) and queueing a fresh investigation.
* **Halting Processing (`overseer/stop`)**: To manually halt bot processing on any pull request or issue at any time, attach the `overseer/stop` label. Overseer immediately skips processing any PR with this label.
* **Retry on Recovery**: If the previous investigation task is in `processed/` but has status `"Failed"` or if 6 hours have passed since the last investigation (`time.Since(lastInvestigatedTime) > 6*time.Hour`), the watcher queues a retry for `pr-investigate`.
* **Assignment**: The bot user remains assigned to the PR while tasks are executing or pending.

### Phase 4: Automated Code Review (`pr-review`)
* **Trigger**: Opted in via the `overseer/review` label (or `<triggerLabel>/review`) on the PR or its referenced parent Issue (`shouldAutoReviewPR`), CI checks are passing (`!hasFailure && !isConflicting`), PR is not yet approved (`!isApproved`), no new unaddressed comments exist (`!hasNewComments`), and the current `HEAD SHA` has not yet been reviewed by the Reviewer Bot identity (`state.lastReviewedSHA != headSHA`).
* **Contextual Instructions**: Parses the PR description and any referenced parent Issue body for a `## Review Instructions` section (`ExtractReviewInstructions`) and passes them via `--instruction <path>`.
* **Identity Selection**: Routes to a user in the `reviewer` pool (e.g., `reviewbot-robot`), executing inside a dedicated Sandbox Pod (`factory-pr-<num>-review`). See detailed architecture in [pr-automated-review.md](file:///usr/local/google/home/barni/workspace/src/github.com/barney-s/gemini-for-kubernetes-development/factory/design/pr-automated-review.md).

## 7. Identity & Assignee Resolution (`selectUserForTask`)

When queueing tasks, the daemon resolves which bot identity should run the task:
1. **Sandbox Pinning**: Checks if a running sandbox already exists for this task and pins the user label from that sandbox.
2. **Issue Assignees**: Inspects the issue's assignees to match any bot in the configured role pool.
3. **PR Author Mapping**: Matches the PR author against the configured role users:
   * If the PR author is in the `agent` pool, the task runs as that agent bot.
   * If the PR author is in the `coder` pool, the task runs as that coder bot.
4. **Fallback**: Falls back to the watcher daemon's own account.

---

## 8. Crash Recovery & Git Sync

* **Crash Recovery**: On watch daemon startup, any tasks found in the `processing/` directory are moved back to `incoming/`. The daemon reads their specifications (including the resolved `assignee`) and executes them.
* **Git State Sync**: At the end of every watch loop cycle, if any changes were made to `/overseer/queues`, the daemon automatically adds, commits, and pushes them back to the state branch (e.g. `overseer`) to keep the remote repository synced.
