// Package issues owns the issue side of the watch daemon: finding the GitHub
// issues that need an agent and queueing the task that works on them.
//
// The Scanner runs as an autonomous goroutine so that a newly created or newly
// assigned issue is queued within one interval, instead of waiting behind the
// pull request evaluation that used to share its cycle. It reaches the rest of
// the daemon through narrow collaborators - a Queue for the tasks it creates,
// an Entities cache for what other subcontrollers have observed, a Sandboxes
// probe and a UserSelector - and never calls into another subcontroller.
//
// Pull requests are deliberately out of scope. GitHub's issue endpoints return
// pull requests alongside issues, and the scanner drops them: the pull request
// scanner lists them itself, on its own cadence.
