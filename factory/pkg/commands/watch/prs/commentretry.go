// commentRetryCooldown is how long after a failed address-feedback task the
// same feedback becomes worth another attempt.
//
// The fast pass runs every minute, so without a delay the whole budget would be
// spent within a few minutes of the first failure - against the same revision,
// the same sandbox image and, usually, the same transient cause. Ten minutes is
// long enough for a flaky sandbox or a GitHub blip to clear, and short enough
// that a reviewer waiting on the fix does not notice the gap.

// commentRetry is what the last attempt at a pull request's review feedback
// left behind: how many consecutive times it has failed against the current
// head, and whether the watcher still owes it another try.
//
// A retry is not a new decision about the feedback but a repetition of one
// already made, which is why it is derived once per evaluation and threaded
// through the phase rather than re-derived where it is needed.

	// spent, so the feedback that attempt was queued for is still outstanding

// scanner-held counter would reset on every restart, which is the one moment a
// pull request stuck in a failing loop is most likely to be handed a fresh
// budget it has not earned.
