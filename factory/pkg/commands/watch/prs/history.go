// The conversation is read up front rather than on demand because nearly every

// round trip. Fetching it once also means every phase reasons about the same
// snapshot, instead of one phase seeing a comment that another did not.

// without them the scanner cannot tell whether feedback is outstanding, and
// acting on that blank picture would queue the wrong task.

// The inline comments are read for the whole pull request in one call and
// grouped by review here, rather than fetched per review. Both spellings
// return the same thing, but the per-review one costs a request each, so its
// price rose with every review a pull request had ever received - which on a
// long-lived change was the single largest term in the cost of evaluating it.
