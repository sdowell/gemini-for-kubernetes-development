// refIssues resolves the issues a pull request closes, fetching each of them at
// most once.
//
// Three separate parts of one evaluation want those issues - the label sync,
// the review opt-in check, and the review task's prompt - and each of them used
// to fetch them itself. They ran within milliseconds of each other against the
// same pull request and got the same answer every time, so the second and third
// fetches bought nothing but rate limit consumption.
//
// The lifetime is deliberately one evaluation. A scanner-wide cache would be
// cheaper still, but it would also mean a label added to a parent issue took
// effect only once the entry expired, and the whole point of the label sync is
// that 'overseer/stop' on an issue stops work on its pull request promptly.
