// Package prs owns the pull request side of the watch daemon: evaluating the
// open pull requests the watcher is responsible for and queueing the work they
// need - rebasing a conflicted branch, investigating failed CI, addressing
// review feedback, or reviewing the change.
//
// Evaluating one pull request costs the better part of a dozen GitHub requests
// (commits, comments, reviews, inline review comments, check runs, commit
// statuses, merge queue state), which is what made this the slowest part of the
// daemon and the reason it now runs as its own goroutine: nothing else has to
// wait behind it. Within a cycle the pull requests are evaluated on a bounded
// worker pool, so one slow pull request no longer holds up the rest.
