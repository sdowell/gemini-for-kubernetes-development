// Package prs owns the pull request side of the watch daemon: evaluating the
// open pull requests the watcher is responsible for and queueing the work they
// need - rebasing a conflicted branch, investigating failed CI, addressing
// review feedback, or reviewing the change.
//
// Evaluating one pull request costs the better part of a dozen GitHub requests
// (commits, comments, reviews, inline review comments, check runs, commit
// statuses, merge queue state), which is what made this the slowest part of the
// daemon and the reason it runs as its own goroutine: nothing else has to wait
// behind it. Within a cycle the pull requests are evaluated one at a time. The
// concurrency this package used to have was traded away deliberately: on a busy
// repository the burst of parallel requests was what pushed the deployment into
// its GitHub rate limit, and a scanner that is throttled evaluates nothing at
// all. Latency is recovered by the cycle cadence, not by fanning out.
