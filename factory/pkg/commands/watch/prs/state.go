// stateStore holds the per-pull-request gating state.
//
// It stays inside this package rather than moving to the shared
// concurrency.EntityStateCache because nothing outside the PR scanner reads it:
// the shared cache exists for state that crosses subcontroller boundaries,
// and putting single-owner bookkeeping there would make it look shared when it
// is not.
//
// The mutex outlives the worker pool it was originally added for: pull requests
// are now evaluated one at a time, so the store has a single writer again. It
// is kept because an uncontended lock costs nothing here - the critical
// sections are map lookups between GitHub round trips - and because it is the
// one thing that would have to be reintroduced, correctly, if evaluation were
// ever parallelised again.
